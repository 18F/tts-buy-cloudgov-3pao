2.0 Background
==============

The mission of General Services Administration (GSA), Technology
Transformation Services (TTS) is to transform how the federal government
builds, buys, and uses digital technology to better serve the public.

TTS built [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) to help teams responsible for
delivering federal digital services to operate a fully compliant
Platform as a Service (PaaS). cloud.gov allows your development team to
focus on products that serve other agency’s mission, without needing to
manage the underlying server infrastructure. Additionally, their
built-in compliance support helps customers create the documentation and
continuing assurance necessary for federal services to comply with FISMA
regulations and agency-specific “Authority to Operate” (ATO)
requirements.

To enable cloud.gov to deliver this mission to customer teams across
many federal agencies, cloud.gov participates in the GSA Federal Risk
and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) as a Cloud Service
Provider. In January 2017, cloud.gov received a FedRAMP Joint
Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at
the Moderate impact level. The FedRAMP program requires annual
re-assessment for all participating Cloud Service Providers, including
annual auditing by an accredited Third Party Assessment Organization
([3PAO](https://www.fedramp.gov/participate/assessors/)).

cloud.gov is a PaaS based on the Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes open source projects, heavily automated using tools such as Terraform, BOSH, and Concourse, using Infrastructure as Code, Immutable Infrastructure, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment principles. It is deployed in AWS GovCloud on Linux. It has user documentation publicly available at https://cloud.gov/docs/ including links to open source code at https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/repos/ and other team operations documentation in that section.

4.0 Evaluation Criteria and Basis for Award
===========================================

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart
[<span
class="underline">8.4</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%208_4.html#wp1089480),
Federal Supply Schedules. FAR Part [<span
class="underline">15</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_1.html#wp1095839),
Contracting by Negotiation, procurement procedures are not being
utilized, except procedures within FAR Part [<span
class="underline">15.4</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208365),
Contract Pricing may be utilized, as allowed, for price analysis. All
submissions in response to this RFQ are considered quotations and not
proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The offerors agree to and
are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The
Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct
discussions, solicit final revised quotations, or use other techniques
associated with FAR Part [<span
class="underline">15</span>](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2015_1.html#wp1095839).

The vendor shall submit a quotation in accordance with the instructions
and terms and conditions of this RFQ and the terms and conditions of the
vendor’s GSA Schedule contract.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value
principles, utilizing the trade-off process. The Government is more
concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with
making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. Offerors
are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are
significantly more important than price. Note that as submissions become
more technically equal in their merit, the total evaluated price becomes
more important.

5.0 Evaluation Process
======================

The Government intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement
as described below. To be considered for award, offerors must
successfully pass through each phase.

1.  Phase 1: Minimum Requirements - pass / fail

2.  Phase 2: Technical Evaluation and Oral Interview - The Government
    > will evaluate the offeror’s performance or capability
    > acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors
    > which are of equal importance to each other: (1) Technical
    > Understanding and Approach and (2) Similar Experience.

3.  Phase 3: Pricing Schedule - Offeror’s Price as provided in the price
    > quotation received via the Google Form will be reviewed separately
    > from the technical evaluation.

5.1 - Phase 1 Minimum Requirements
-----------------------------------

Minimum requirements are defined as follows. At the time of quote
submission:

-   The 3PAO has completed a Readiness Assessment, Initial Assessment,
    > or Annual Assessment for a FedRAMP PaaS cloud system;

-   FedRAMP categorizes the 3PAO as fully compliant with all [<span
    > class="underline">3PAO
    > standards</span>](https://portal.a2la.org/requirements/A2LA_R311.pdf)
    > promulgated by FedRAMP;

| Closing Remarks and Frequently Asked Questions | 5 minutes               |

### *Rules*

No part of these Interviews constitutes discussions as contemplated in FAR Part 15. For this reason, proposal revisions are not requested and will not be allowed.

The Government may take notes during the presentation at its discretion, and may use such notes in the evaluation. No copies will be provided to any Quoters.

The Interview consists of an unstructured question and answer session on technical factors. The Government’s questions may differ among the Quoters based on what needs elaboration.

Offerors will not be able to use or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials, including handouts.

During the Interview, the offeror will respond to Government’s questions related to the technical aspects of the offeror’s proposal.
 
Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member names and roles on both the Government and vendor teams. Time for introductions will not be allocated to business development purposes.

Although the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer questions about the technical aspects of their respective quotes. The goal of the Interview is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed Technical approach to accomplish the objectives of this task.

This part of the Interviews will not exceed 40 minutes. The CO will strictly enforce this time limit on all Interviews. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the Interview.
 
The session will conclude with closing remarks and responses to questions and answers from offerors.

The entire Interview will take place remotely via video chat and/or teleconference. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using a tool such as Zoom or Appear.in).

The Government will schedule the date and time of the Interviews with each offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each offeror’s quote submission. Time slots will be assigned randomly. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any offeror’s Interviews date at the discretion of the CO.

Offerors may include as many participants as are necessary. Offerors should note that the Government will be asking technical questions during the Interview, so non-technical personnel may not need to attend.
 
After the Interviews, vendors shall email the names of everyone who attended to the meeting organizers.

5.3 - Phase 3 Price Evaluation

The vendor shall submit a quote either at or below its current GSA
Schedule price. Prices shall be submitted via the [<span

shall be evaluated for reasonableness and consistency with industry
standards.
