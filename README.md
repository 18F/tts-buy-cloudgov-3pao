## Statement of Need

To continue to successfully achieve cloud.govâ€™s mission, cloud.gov
requires annual re-assessment for all participating Cloud Service Providers, including annual auditing by an accredited Third Party Assessment Organization
([3PAO](https://www.fedramp.gov/participate/assessors/)).

### What we're hoping to end up with

Additional information is provided in [the Performance Work Statement](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-cloudgov-3pao/blob/master/solicitation_documents/PWS.md), but in short:

The vendor must provide security assessments and reports for an Annual Assessment, with options for including Significant Change Request assessments, for cloud.gov at the JAB Moderate security level. These security assessments must meet all of the requirements of a FedRAMP security assessment, as outline within the Request of Quotation section 3.0 Requirements.
